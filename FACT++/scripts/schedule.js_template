'use strict';

// This list contains the schedule for one or several nights.
// The schedule consists of observations and measurements.
// An observation is compiled by several measurements.
// Most measurements (like RATESCAN) cannot be interrupted, but
// will be finished at some point (like a single run).
// A measurement which takes until the next observation is started is DATA.
// Whenever a measurement is finished and the start time of a new
// observation has passed, the new observation is started.
// In an observation it makes only sense that the last measurment
// is data. All previous measurement just take as much time as they take.
// Note that after each measurement, a new observation might be started
// if the start time of the new observation has passed. Thus there is,
// strictly speaking, no gurantee that any other than the first measurement
// of one observation will ever be excuted.
// A list of observations must end with a shutdown.
//
// here is an example:
