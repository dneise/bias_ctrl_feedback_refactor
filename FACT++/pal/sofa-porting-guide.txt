Some SLA routines migrate directly to SOFA. Simple PAL wrappers are
made available using the SLA name but new code should use the SOFA
variant directly. The PAL routines should not be called internally
by other PAL routines.

Dvn    => Pn
Dvxv   => Pxp
Epb    => Epb

Gmst   => Gmst06
Hfk5z  => Hfk5z


Some SLA routines are close to the same but have different arguments
so a PAL routine is provided although it is probably best to port software
to the SOFA variant:

slaDat =>palDat => iauDat

slaGeoc has different arguments and uses the WGS84 model. The code is not
quite one-to-one.
