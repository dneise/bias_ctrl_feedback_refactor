The backround colors have the following meaning:
<ul class='help'>
<li>Source above 30&deg; zenith distance. The sensitivity is at
optimum.</li>
<li>Source between 65&deg; and 30&deg; zenith distance. The sensitivity
is significantly reduced compared to low zenith angle
observations.</li>
<li>Source between 85&deg; and 65&deg; zenith distance. Observation of
such a source is only useful in very very special  cases. The

distance or below the horizon.</li>
</ul>
