Moon

<h4>Moon rise/set</h4>
Moon rise, moon culmination and moon set are always caluclated such
that the time displayed refers to the next moon rise, culmination or
set respectively. A blue background marks the next event to happen.

<h4>Disk</h4>
The moon disk is the visible brightness of the moon. The time in brackets
is the time to the next moon set or rise, depening on which event
happens earlier. An up-arrow denotes that it is the time to the moon rise,
a down-arrow that it is the time to the moon set.

<h4>Position</h4>
If the moon is above horizon, its current position is displayed in local
coordinates. The background color represents
<ul class='help'>
<li>The moon is above 25&deg; zenith distance</li>
<li>The moon is between 25&deg; and 45&deg; zenith distance</li>
<li>The moon is lower than 45&deg; zenith distance</li>
<li>The moon is not visible</li>
</ul>
The assumption is that the further the moon is from the zenith, the
more light is scattered and the more influence the moon has on
the observations. It does not directly translate into the particular
observation conditions or observability.

<h4>Source distance to moon</h4>
The table displays the angular distance between the sources from the
database and the moon at any time of the day. The colors represent
<ul class='help'>
<li>No moon light is directly hitting the G-APDs</li>
<li>The distance is very close to the direct or indirect field-of-view of the cones.</li>
<li>The moon is within th efield-of-view. This condition should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
</ul>

<i>Note that the color scales are not well motivated as of today. Anybody
is invited to investigate this issue in more details.</i>
