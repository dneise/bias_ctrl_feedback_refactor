Tracking
|
When the telescope is tracking (and only during that), it propagates
some tracking related information through the dim-network. This page
shows the values of the latest received report.

The control deviation is the deviation measured between the shaft-encoder
position at the telescope axis and the command position by the controller.
Theoretically, real mispointing could be larger due to additional
bending of the structure.

If a dedicated source is tracked, a source name is displayed. If
the moon is above the horizon, the distance to the moon is displayed.

The colors represent
<ul class='help'>
<li>No moon light is directly hitting the G-APDs</li>
<li>The distance is very close to the direct or indirect field-of-view of the cones.</li>
<li>The moon is within th efield-of-view. This condition should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
</ul>

<i>Note that the color scales are not well motivated as of today. Anybody
is invited to investigate this issue in more details.</i>

|<h4>Graphics</h4>
The graphics display the history of the control deviation. Note that it
is only updated during tracking and the time axis is just simply binned,
<I>i.e.</I> that one point represents one service update and they need
not to be equidistant in time.
