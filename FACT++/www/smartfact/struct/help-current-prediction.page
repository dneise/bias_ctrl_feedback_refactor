Current prediction
|
From the zenith angle of the moon, the distance to the moon and
the moon disc, it is possible to predict the expected current per
pixel quite accurately.

The shows this predicition of all sources visible between the start of
the astronomical twilight in the evening and the end of the
astronomical twilight in the morning.

The title shows roughly the start and end time of the time range displayed
and the number of minutes corresponding to one of the twenty
steps on the x-axis.

To relate the curves to the sources, the maximum predicted current for
each source is given above the graphics in brackets. The sources are ordered
in time when the maximum is reached.
