Layout
|<h4>Home</h4>
Links from all other pages (except the home page itself) to the home page
|
|<h4>Watchdog</h4>
The two dots on the left and the right of the title change their color
with every retrieved data or graphics file, respectively. This is a way
to find out if the continous retrieval is still in progress.
|
|<h4>Time stamp of displayed data</h4>
Each data file which is loaded from the server comes with a time-stamp.
This time-stamp is displayed here. This allows for example to find out
whether the values are still valid or just the last values produced by the
system hours ago. If this time-stamp is older than sixty seconds,
the time is displayed in red color.

|<h4>Link to help page</h4>

<i>e.g.</i> meaning of background colors, etc.

|<h4>Link to control page</h4>

|<h4>Stop script</h4>
If this button is pressed a STOP is sent to the script control and the script
should be terminated. On pages which are updated regularly, the color
shows if a script is running (green) or not (red). When the 
button is displayed uncolored, the data is in general not updated often enough
to deliver up-to-date information.
|
|<h4>Current UTC</h4>
The current UTC time is displayed. If this does not happen anymore there
is a problem with the JavaScript. This is a bug and should never happen.
