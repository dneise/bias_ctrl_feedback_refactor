FACT
|<h4>G-APD (med/max)</h4>
Here the status of the bias system is summarized.

The backround colors have the following meaning:
<ul class='help'>
<li>DNS online, MCP taking data, FAD taking data</li>
<li>Bias voltage switched on and median current above 60&micro;A or
maximum current (excluding faulty pixels) above 80&micro;A</li>
<li>Bias voltage switched on and median current above 70&micro;A or
maximum current (excluding faulty pixels) above 90&micro;A or any patch
in OverCurrent or MCP not Idle and bias voltage is neither well defined
switched on (VoltageOn) nor well defined off (VoltageOff).</li>
<li>Bias neither ramping, nor in OverCurrent, nor in the well defined
voltage on or off state.</li>
<li>Bias crate is currently being calibrated</li>
</ul>

If the bias crate is currently calibrated asterix' are displayed, otherwise
median pixel current and the maximum pixel current. The maximum excludes
the crazy pixels. If a channel is on OverCurrent <I>(OC)</I> is appended.
If the bias crate has not yet been calibrated the maximum current is
replaced by a dash. If the bias current have been calibarted 
already, also the total power consumed by the G-APDs
is displayed otherwise the median applied voltage.
