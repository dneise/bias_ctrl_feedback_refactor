FACT
|<h4>Drive</h4>
The current drive status is displayed if the dim-network is online
and the drivectrl has connection to cosy.

The backround colors have the following meaning:
<ul class='help'>
<li>Drive is tracking</li>
<li>Drive is tracking and the control deviation is larger than one arc-minute</li>
<li>Drive is tracking and the control deviation is larger than two arc-minutes or the drive is in ERROR state</li>
<li>Drive is offline, or online and neither moving nor tracking</li>
<li>Drive is moving</li>
</ul>

If the drive is online, the current pointing position is displayed. Between
sun-rise and sun-set a sun-symbol (&#9788;) is displayed. If between
sun-set and sun-rise the moon is above horizon, a moon-symbol (&#9790;)
is displayed. During tracking the current control deviation is 
displayed behin a plus-minus symbol (&plusmn;). If the source name of
the current tracking position is available it is displayed in []-parenthesis.
If the drive is currently moving a moving-symbol (&#10227;) is displayed.

If the drive is online and in error state this is also indicated by the
extension [ERR]. This should make it easier to detect this state.

If the drive is switched off and either the sun- or the moon-symbol is
visible, it is extended with either the time until sun-set (indicated 
with a down-arrow &darr;) or the moon disk visibility in percent.
When the drive is switched on, this information is omitted due to space
reasons.

The &otimes;-symbol means that the drive is locked.

More detailed informations about the sun and moon can be found at the
weather page. More detailed tracking and pointing information at the
drive page.
