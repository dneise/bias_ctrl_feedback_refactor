FACT
|<h4>Relative camera temperature</h4>
The difference between the average temperatur in the sensor compartment
and the outside temperature as measured by the MAGIC weather station
is displayed if both value are available.

A green background means
that a valid number is displayed, i.e. that the camera is
switched on because values were recived from the slow control
board and values are received from the MAGIC weather station.

The backround colors have the following meaning:
<ul class='help'>
<li>Relative camera temperature as usual</li>
<li>Relative camera temperature above 9&deg;C</li>
<li>Relative camera temperature abive 15&deg;C</li>
</ul>
