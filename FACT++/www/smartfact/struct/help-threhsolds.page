Thresholds
|
Numbers are given for the median board (N/4) and patch (discriminator)
threshold. The graphics shows a history of the minimum allowed threshold
determined by the rate control before the start of each run. Whenever 
this calibration is done, <i>i.e.</i> the minimum threshold during
data-taking is calibrated before each run, the resulting value is 
distributed. Under normal circumstances one point in the grahics
will therefore correspond to one data-taking run.
