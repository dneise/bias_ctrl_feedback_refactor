Datafile format
|
A datafile is a file which is automatically loaded every few seconds
and the values displayed on a page are updated. If the page name
is <I>mypage.page</I> the name of the corresponding data file is
<I>mypage.data</I>.

The first line of the data file always contains a thirteen-digit number
which is the time (in UTC) corresponding to the contained data
as Unix time (milli-seconds since 1/1/1970). Seprated with tabs, it can
contain to additional numbers. The first one defines if the warning
sign is displayed (&gt;=1 means that it is displayed) and the
second defines whether the script stop sign is displayed in green or red.
For data-files which are not guranteed to be updated in reasonable
intervals, it is advisable to not write the two numbers at all.

Each following line contains columns seperated by tabs. The first column
contains the background color of the row. It can be given in any
representation accepted by HTML, usually #rrggbb. The following columns
contain values or text which will replace the $N in the format given
in the page file, <i>e.g.</i>

If the second line of the data file contains

<pre>
blue\t0\t42.0
</pre>

while \t here representas the ascii character 9 ('\t' in C and C++), and the format
in the page files looks like

<pre>
$1 shoes and $0 socks
</pre>

the row displayed will be

<pre>
42.0 shoes and 0 socks
</pre>

with a blue background.
