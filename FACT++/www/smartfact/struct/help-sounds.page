Sounds
|
Sounds have to be explicitly switched on in the URL, <i>e.g.</I>

<pre>
http://[url]/?sound
</pre>

Sounds will only be available on pages with regular updates, which are
the main page and the status page. If sounds are not available,
a stroke out speaker is displayed.

Note that these pages are only reloaded once in a few seconds. If more
than one sound is to be played during that time only the last sound
will be played, <I>i.e.</I> that in special circumstances some sounds
might be missed.

In the following examples of all available sounds are listed.
|
|<h4>Startup</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/startup.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/startup.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
This sound is played whenever the control-program of the slow control board
(fscctrl) gets contact to the hardware. This is usually the case when
the camera is switched on.
|
|<h4>Shutdown</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/shutdown.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/shutdown.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
This sound is played whenever the control-program of the slow control board
(fscctrl) looses contact with the hardware. This is usually the case when
the camera is switched off.
|
|<h4>Error</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/error.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/error.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
If a severe error happens, this sounds is displayed. Until the error
remains, a warning symbol is also displayed in the upper left corner 
and links to current error messages. A history of erros is accessible
from the status page via the Smartfact entry.
|
|<h4>Script ends</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/ding.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/ding.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
A ding is played if a script has ended or been stopped.
|
|<h4>Manual run ends</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/dong.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/dong.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
If a run has been started manually, <I>i.e.</i> no script is running
at the same time, a ding is played when the run end or to be more
precise when the Master Control Program (MCP) changed its state
from TakingData to Idle which happens when the data acquisition (fadctrl)
leaves its state WritingData.
|
|<h4>Automatic run ends</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/losticks.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/losticks.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
For this tick-sound the same conditions apply than for the previous sound
except that it is played when a script is executed while the run ends.
The same sound is played whenever a run is started, <i>i.e.</I> the Master
Control Program (MCP) changed its state from TriggerOn to TakingData
which happens when the first even has been received and the data 
acquisition (fadctrl) changed its state to WritingData.

|
|<h4>Message</h4>
<audio controls id="audio">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="audio/message.mp3"/>
  <source type="audio/ogg" src="audio/message.ogg"/>
</audio><br/>
This sound will be played if a new message is distributed by the chat-server.
The chatlog and the possibility to send messages is available from the
Chat Server entry in the status page.
