/** @fn StateMachineImp::Execute()

This is what the state machine is doing in a certain state
continously. In an idle state this might just be doing nothing.

In the tracking state of the drive system this might be sending
new command values to the drive based on its current position.

The current state of the state machine can be accessed by GetCurrentState()

@returns
   Usually it should just return the current state. However, sometimes
   execution might lead to a new state, e.g. when a hardware error
   is detected. In this case a new state can be returned to put the state
   machine into a different state. Note, that the function is responsible
   of doing all actions connected with the state change itself.
   If not overwritten it returns the current status.

**/
// ***************************************************************************
/** @fn StateMachineImp::Configure(const Event &evt)

This function is called when a configuration event is to be processed.

The current state of the state machine is accessible via GetCurrentState().

The issued event and its corresponding data is accessible through
evn. (see Event and DimEvent for details) Usually such an event
will not change the state. In this case fCurrentState will be returned.
However, to allow the machine to go into an error state it is possible
to change the state by giving a different return value. When the
Configure function is called the validity of the state transition has
already been checked.

@param evt
   A reference to an Event object with the event which should
   be processed. Note that the cmd-object will get deleted after the
   function has returned.

@returns
   Usually it should just return the current state. However, sometimes
   a configuration command which was not intended to change the state
   has to change the state, e.g. to go to an error state. Return any
   other state than GetCurrentState() can put the state machine into
   a different state.  Note, that the function is responsible
   of doing all actions connected with the state change itself.
   If not overwritten it returns kSM_FatalError.

**/
// ***************************************************************************
/** @fn StateMachineImp::Transition(const Event &evt)

This function is called if a state transision was requested.

The current state of the state machine is accessible via GetCurrentState().

The new state is accessible via evt.GetTargetState().

The event and its corresponding data is accessible through evt.
(see DimCommand and DimEvent for details) If the transition was
successfull the new status should be returned. If it was unsuccessfull
either the old or any other new status will be returned.

When the Transition function is called the validity of the state
transition has already been checked.

@param evt
   A reference to an Event object with the event which should
   be processed. Note that the cmd-object will get deleted after the
   function has returned.

@returns
   Usually it should return the new state. However, sometimes
   a transition command might has to change the state to a different
   state than the one requested (e.g. an error has occured) In this
   case it is also allowed to return a different state.  Note, that the
   function is responsible of doing all actions connected with the
   state change itself.
   If not overwritten it returns kSM_FatalError.
